HISTORY OF COMPUTERS:

Since the evolution of humans, devices have
been used for calculations for thousands of years.
One of the earliest and most well-known devices
was an abacus. Then in 1822, the father of
computers, Charles Babbage began developing
what would be the first mechanical computer. And
then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical
Engine which was a general-purpose computer. It
contained an ALU, some basic flowchart
principles and the concept of integrated memory.

Then more than a century later in the history of
computers, we got our first electronic computer
for general purpose. It was the ENIAC, which
stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and
Computer. The inventors of this computer were
John W. Mauchly and J.Presper Eckert.

And with times the technology developed and the
computers got smaller and the processing got
faster. We got our first laptop in 1981 and it was
introduced by Adam Osborne and EPSON.
